This quad display slice has 4 box displays with passive read ability. It has a fully hopperlocked layout with no visible pistons. The bottom displays has one buffer box with global first box placement. For full hopperlocking, the top displays require a gap every 32 blocks. Box collection is not fully reliable. Top display will break if used aggressively.
## Features
- 4 box displays & chests per slice.
- Minimum hoppers & chests for this layout. Fully hopper locked.
- In slice lists for which chests need to be restocked from empty.
- Easily reachable & visible inventories.
- Control logic can be relatively simple.
## Considerations
- Box collection is not fully reliable.
- Top display will break if used aggressively.
