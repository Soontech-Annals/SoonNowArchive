This quad display slice has 4 box displays with passive read ability and parallelized control logic. It has a fully hopperlocked layout with no visible pistons. The bottom displays has one buffer box with global first box placement. For full hopperlocking, the top displays require a gap every 32 blocks. Box collection is not fully reliable. Top display will break if used aggressively.
## Features
- Minimum hoppers & chests for this layout
- Fully hopper locked
- In-slice lists for which chests need to be restocked from empty
- Each quarter-slice can restock and call in parallel
- All inventories easily reachable/visible
- Control logic somewhat simple
## Considerations
- Box collection is not fully reliable
- Top display will break if used aggressively
