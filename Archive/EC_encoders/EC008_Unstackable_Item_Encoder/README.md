A device that sorts unstackable items using Pyra's unstackable sorter and then outputs boxes of the sorted items along with an encoded signal. The device features a built-in queue to output boxes of items upon request. The device is fully hopperlocked and is designed to sort music discs, enchanted books, potions, flint & steel, shears, powdered snow buckets, lava buckets, water buckets, boats, armor and minecarts in that order.
