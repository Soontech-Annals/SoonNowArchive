This device is able to store and retrieve items with a specific decimal code. This may be useful as a temp storage in an encoded dynamic sorting system.
## Features
- Has 100 different codes/item types. a dropper of storage per code.
- Random access. Can insert and retrieve items in constant time in any order.
- Half hopperspeed order throughput. Can execute insertions and retrievals every 16 game ticks (exclusive, can't do both at same time).
- Hopperlocked. Can be fully hopperlocked.
- Togglestateless. No piston toggle states.
## Considerations
- Directional, do not rotate 90 degrees (can rotate 180)
