This device can store and retrieve non-box items with a specific decimal code. This may be useful for implementing dictionaries in an encoded dynamic sorting system. The device uses a 50-address item memory system with a hoppercart based slot cycling system to store and retrieve 1000 different items at near constant time.
## Features
- Has 1000 different codes/item types. Items are stored in slots inside shulker boxes inside a dropper.
- Random access. Can insert and retrieve items in constant time in any order.
- Compact. 22x10x19 volume.
- Maximum 55gt latency from call request to item.
## Considerations
- Cannot store boxes, only non-box items are allowed
