The IM06 can temporarily store and retrieve boxes with a binary code. Intended for keeping the leftover partials of bulk items, for future merging operations. 256 different types can be held by this device.
## Features
- Extremely compact, 13x9x7 lwh
- Very accessible inputs, output into waterstream, perfect for plumbing
- Has simple temp logic that gives out both boxes, if another one was in storage already
- Uses water buckets as placeholders, turns them into buckets to store very compact when not needed
- Quick cycle and reset, min.102gt - max.598gt = 17.5 seconds on average per request
- Only uses 21 hoppers, wiring for hopperlocking included
